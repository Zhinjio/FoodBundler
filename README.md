## History
FoodBundler was inspired by [efeketket's Stackraft](https://modrinth.com/datapack/stackraft). I wanted to change a few things, and of course, bring it up to date with 1.21.5. I was also looking for a good place to sink my teeth into this whole datapack thing, so off I went. This is the result. My first datapack (so be gentle), and basically a complete rewrite of the original. In the spirit of the good will of modding and all that, I've maintained the original license in this datapack as well.
## Description
So what does it do? It allows you to compress most food related items into a 9:1 stackable block. Think, basically, exactly like a hay bale, but for all the remaining food items as well. Removed from the original are the non-food items, like gunpowder, that Stackraft gave recipes for as well. I wanted to stick to food items, so those have been removed. I've also added some that were notably missing from the original as well, and included most seeds too.
## Instructions
- Getting a full stack of the compress-able items will give you an advancement and the recipe.
- Uncompress an item by holding it in your hand and right click (use) to pop the uncompressed items into your inventory
## Support
Thanks so much to [NiceRon](https://modrinth.com/user/NiceRon) and the crew at the [Explorer's Eden](https://modrinth.com/organization/explorers-eden) for kindly allowing me to use their Discord as a place to park my butt and provide chat support for this datapack. They've been incredibly helpful and patient as I learn how this stuff all works and providing mentoring!
